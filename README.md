# Background information 
Hi !

My name is Leszek.

I am currently studying computer science at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology at Faculty of Electronics.
I started my journey as a programmer right after I have finished High-school (2017). Since then I am trying different technologies and programming languages. I started as a C++ developer and that allowed me to understand most of the object oriented programming principles. Recently I discovered and understood the beauty of modern high-level programming languages such as C# and Python.  
I spend most of my free time on coding and learning. Otherwise I am hanging out with friends and playing basketball.



# Description of the repository
This repository contains all my simple projects which were developed in order to learn the basics of solving different problems in world of computer science.

There are different languages in here because i am still not sure which way i want to head to. That's the reason why I am trying different technologies and programming languages in order to get a grip on one that suits me the best.
